# Fss

An opinionated styling library for F#.
Have CSS as a first class citizen in your F# projects.

Built atop the fantastic [Emotion-js](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) library and uses that for all CSS generation.

## Examples 🤓
Quick example here, check the documentation for more information.
```fsharp
let buttonStyle =
    fss
        [
            BackgroundColor.Hex "44c767"
            BorderRadius' (px 30)
            BorderWidth' (px 1)
            BorderStyle.Solid
            BorderColor.Hex "18ab29"
            Display.InlineBlock
            Cursor.Pointer
            FontSize' (px 17)
            Hover
                [
                    BackgroundColor.Hex "5cbf2a"
                ]
        ]
button [ ClassName buttonStyle ] [ str "Click me" ]
```

## Motivation 🤔
While you have some good alternatives with F# such as:
- [Fulma](https://fulma.github.io/Fulma/)
- [TypedCssClasses](https://github.com/zanaptak/TypedCssClasses) a type provider if you want to write CSS or SCSS
- Or some kind of webpack if you want to use CSS or SCSS directly.

Ultimately you will find what you like best and whatever suits your needs, I find that writing CSS is annoying.
It is not discoverable, not type-safe and requires some setup.

The primary goal of this project is to avoid all of that and have an easy way to write type-safe discoverable styling with F# that supports most of the CSS spec.

Download one nuget package and you are ready to go.

## Features 🛠
- Uses Emotion-js to generate the CSS and thus gets some of its amazing features.
- Discoverable, use the IDE to help you write the styling.
- Trying to support a big swathe of the CSS spec
- Works independently of Fable and Feliz and thus works with both (and without them)
- All the benefits of having your styling in your language as a first class citizen.

## Installation 💾
To install `Fss` you need to install the nuget package.
```
# nuget
dotnet add package Fss-lib

# paket
paket add Fss-lib --project ./project/path
```

## Disclaimer ⚠️
Firstly not the entire spec has been implemented, and  I am sure to have made a mistake or two.
Let me know if you find any! 😅
Second of all this is the first library I have ever written. Development is ongoing and changes will happen.
More of the CSS-spec will be supported, bugs will be ironed out and so will the library as a whole.
