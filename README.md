An opinionated styling library for F#.
Have CSS as a first class citizen in your F# projects.

Built atop the fantastic [Emotion-js](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) library and uses that for all CSS generation.

I have also written an article on the project you can read [here](https://blogg.bekk.no/introducing-fss-cff9fdd300a1)

## [Documentation ðŸ“–](https://bjorn-strom.github.io/FSS/)

## Examples ðŸ¤“
Quick example here, check the documentation for more information.
```fsharp
let buttonStyle =
    fss
        [
            BackgroundColor.hex "44c767"
            BorderRadius' (px 30)
            BorderWidth' (px 1)
            BorderStyle.solid
            BorderColor.hex "18ab29"
            Display.inlineBlock
            Cursor.pointer
            FontSize' (px 17)
            Hover
                [
                    BackgroundColor.hex "5cbf2a"
                ]
        ]
button [ ClassName buttonStyle ] [ str "Click me" ]
```

And with Feliz syntax.
```fsharp
Html.button [
    prop.text "Click me"
    prop.fss [
        BackgroundColor.hex "44c767"
        BorderRadius' (px 30)
        BorderWidth' (px 1)
        BorderStyle.solid
        BorderColor.hex "18ab29"
        Display.inlineBlock
        Cursor.pointer
        FontSize' (px 17)
        Hover [
            BackgroundColor.hex "5cbf2a"
        ]
    ]
]
```

## Motivation ðŸ¤”
While you have some good alternatives with F# such as:
- [Fulma](https://fulma.github.io/Fulma/)
- [TypedCssClasses](https://github.com/zanaptak/TypedCssClasses) a type provider if you want to write CSS or SCSS
- Or some kind of webpack configuration if you want to use CSS or SCSS directly.

Ultimately you will find what you like best and whatever suits your needs, I find that writing CSS is annoying.
It is not discoverable, not type-safe and requires some setup.

The primary goal of this project is to avoid all of that and have an easy way to write type-safe discoverable styling with F# that supports most of the CSS spec.
It was also important to me that it works independently of frontend frameworks, so this will work with Fable.React, Feliz or any other framework you want to use.

3 major goals of Fss
- I did not want to reinvent the wheel - it should be easy to use if you already know CSS.
- Writing CSS in F# to be discoverable, strongly typed, and the IDE to help out as much as possible.
- It is important to support pseudo-classes and elements as well as animations, counters and combinators.

Download one nuget package and one npm package and you are ready to go.

## Features ðŸ› 
- Uses Emotion-js to generate the CSS and therefore gets some of its amazing features for free
- Discoverable, use the IDE to help you write the styling
- Trying to support a big part of the CSS spec
- Works independently of Fable.React and Feliz and thus works with both (and without them)
- All the benefits of having your styling in your language as a first class citizen

## Installation ðŸ’¾
To install `Fss` you need to install the nuget package.
```
# nuget
dotnet add package Fss-lib

# paket
paket add Fss-lib --project ./project/path
```

And you need to install [Emotion-js](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion).
Fss uses version 11 or greater.
```
# npm
npm i @emotion/css

# yarn
yarn add @emotion/css
```

If you want to use Fss.Feliz as well then run:
```
# nuget
dotnet add package Fss-lib-feliz

# paket
paket add Fss-lib-feliz --project ./project/path
```
