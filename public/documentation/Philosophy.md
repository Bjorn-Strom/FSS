## Philosophy

The main idea behind Fss is an extendable library that provides discoverable CSS.
Write CSS in F# quick and easy!

There exists some quite good styling alternatives in F# already.

- [Fulma](https://fulma.github.io/Fulma/) - which is a really nice wrapper over Bulma
- [TypedCssClasses](https://github.com/zanaptak/TypedCssClasses) - a type provider if you want to generate types from existing CSS.
- A webpack configuration for CSS or SCSS

Ultimately I believe you will find whatever solution suits your needs the best.
If you want to write your CSS all in F#, I believe Fss is the best solution for this currently.

Writing CSS in your language has some nice benefits:
- Types, your code will not compile if you have written incorrect styling
- Declarative and maintainable styling
- Easy to set up and use
- Take advantage of nice F# syntax and features
- Scoping! Have local scope that will not affect styling somewhere else
- Easy parameterization of your styling
- And much more!
